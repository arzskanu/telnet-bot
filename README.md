# telnet-bot

I am using rivescript and it requires the server to use nodejs

running it after installing nodejs 

node bot.js

but you will need the required lib files and brain files assoated with the orignal files from rivescript-js

# modifications
small modifications have been made so far i won't list any of them just yet until i can test them better and find a good base for the .rive script brain files.
